If you search with the artist name on the searchbar, you can get your artist's "Top-10 Tracks on Spotify" as a table.
And if you click the column name like "Spotify Popularity", you can get the data on ascending order of the "Spotify Popularity".

1. Created a single-page using React
2. Fetched the public API(Spotify) data for the request
3. Used npm 'react-table' to display the data as a table
4. Used Heroku for running an app

* accesstoken from Spotify is expired periodically, so it might not work if it is expired.
  I should have got new token whenever it expired.
